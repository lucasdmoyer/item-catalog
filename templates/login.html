          clientid is the Client ID we generated on console.developers.google.com
          redirecturi sets a post message that enable sthe one-time use code flow
          accesstype = offline allows user to make requests to the Google API server even if the user is not logged in
          cookiepoliy determines the scope of URls that can access the cookie, so we use single_host_orign because our website is a single domain with no subdomiains
          data call back - if user clicks and grants us access to their profile this callback method is called and given the one time use code with access token
          data-approvalpromt force means that our user has to login each time we visit the login page and doesn't check to see if they are already logged in, useful for debugging but will disable later
